## [2.1.11] - 2026-07-04
### Added
- **Centralized Release Notes**: The Control Center now aggregates and displays release notes and changelogs from all modular services.
- **Service API Expansion**: Added versioning and release notes endpoints to the Rating System service.

## [2.1.10] - 2026-07-04
### Added
- **Modular Containerization**: Split the monolithic application into 10 specialized, lightweight services (`muma-scanner`, `muma-tagger`, `muma-downloader`, etc.).
- **Smart Build System**: Introduced `scripts/affected.sh` and optimized `bup` to skip builds for unedited modules.
- **Unified Base Image**: Created `muma-base` to share core music logic and dependencies, reducing image size and ensuring consistency.
- **Parallel Builds**: Optimized `build.sh` and `publish.sh` to execute Docker operations in parallel.

### Fixed
- Fixed missing `pymysql` and other dependencies in `ml-analyzer` worker.
- Silenced database permission warnings in workers when tables/views are already managed by migrations.
- Improved Telegram worker stability with dedicated `asyncio` loop management.
- Resolved circular dependencies by consolidating core logic in the base image.

## [2.1.9] - 2026-07-04
### Fixed
- Fixed `ml-analyzer` being offline by setting up a repeat loop and proper Docker command.
- Resolved `RuntimeError` in Telegram worker by improving `asyncio` loop management and explicitly passing it to Telethon.
- Removed redundant `yt-dlp` updates on service startup to speed up container initialization.

## [2.1.8] - 2026-07-04
### Fixed
- Improved Telegram worker stability by using a dedicated event loop and modern `asyncio` patterns.

## [2.1.7] - 2026-07-04
### Fixed
- Fixed `KeyError` in YouTube downloader by aligning configuration keys with `ConfigStore`.
- Added missing `muma-rating-system` to build and deployment scripts.

## [2.1.6] - 2026-07-04
### Fixed
- Consolidated all service code into the base image to resolve circular and cross-service dependencies.
- Added all common dependencies (`yt-dlp`, `telethon`, `patool`, etc.) to the base image to ensure all workers can share the same entry points.

## [2.1.5] - 2026-07-04
### Fixed
- Fixed API server crash due to missing dependencies (`markdown`, `pydantic`) in worker images.
- Fixed `UnboundLocalError` in API initialization.
- Fixed package recognition for `services.tagger` in modular workers by including `__init__.py` in the base image.

## [2.1.4] - 2026-07-04
### Fixed
- Fixed missing `requests` dependency in Management API.
- Fixed `ModuleNotFoundError` in modular worker images by moving core music logic (`BaseSong`, etc.) to the base image.
- Improved Management API Dockerfile to inherit from the shared base image.

## [2.1.3] - 2026-07-04
### Changed
- **Consolidated Deployment**: Unified root `deploy.sh` and `scripts/deploy-stack.sh` into a single `scripts/deploy.sh`.
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Updated `bup` to use the new centralized deployment script.

## [2.1.2] - 2026-07-04
### Fixed
- Fixed SQL syntax errors in `migrate_v2.sql` for MariaDB compatibility.
- Unified artist and label genre rule tables into a normalized structure with backward-compatible views.
- Improved database initialization logic to handle table renames and view creation.

## [2.1.1] - 2026-07-04
### Added
- Formalized `scanner_service` in Docker Compose configurations for production deployment.
- Created `docker-compose.full.yml` as a consolidated configuration for Portainer and manual stack management.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-07-04

### Added
- **Artist-Genre Editor**: A new Spotify-inspired UI for mapping artists and labels to genres.
- **Library Scanner**: A new `muma-library-scanner` service that automatically indexes audio files into the database.
- **ReadonlySong**: A specialized song class for metadata extraction without file modification.
- **Database Schema v3**: Added tables for `rules_artist_genres`, `rules_label_genres`, `library_artists`, and `library_labels`.
- **API Endpoints**: New REST endpoints for artists, labels, and genre-mapping rules.

### Fixed
- Improved database connection reliability in the Management API.
- Standardized Docker worker configurations.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-07-04
### Added
- Created `scripts/deploy-stack.sh`, a generalized Docker stack deployment tool supporting Portainer discovery, SSH transfer, and intelligent fallbacks.
- Support for initial stack creation: the deployment script now automatically creates the stack if it does not exist yet using a local template.
- Modular build system with separate `build.sh`, `publish.sh`, and `deploy.sh` scripts.
- Versioned Docker tagging: images are now tagged with both `:latest` and the repository version (e.g., `:2.0.0`).
- Portainer Webhook support for automated Stack updates.
- Automatic Docker group permission handling via `sg docker` re-execution.
- Standardized `.env` configuration for all deployment targets.
- `bup` shortcut for the full build-publish-deploy pipeline.
- Proactive Docker registry authentication checks.
- Advanced audio feature extraction (MFCC, ZCR, Rolloff, Chroma) in ML analyzer.

### Changed
- **Deployment**: Refactored `deploy.sh` to use the new generalized `deploy-stack.sh` helper, simplifying per-project deployment scripts.
- **Deployment**: Enhanced stack discovery to support `PORTAINER_HOST` for pulling master templates.
- **Deployment**: Improved robustness with `base64` template transfer and automated tab-to-space conversion in compose files.
- Refactored core to use normalized database schema v2.
- Updated `install.sh` to automate environment setup and dependency installation.
- Optimized Docker builds by using system FFmpeg packages instead of source builds.
- Unified deployment variables across repositories.

### Fixed
- Fixed Docker Hub push denial by adding pre-flight authentication checks.
- Fixed path typos in configuration store and downloader modules.
- Improved database storage robustness for high-load analysis jobs.
